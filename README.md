#Web Tutoring Site JavaEE 7#
======================
This is my JavaEE 7 thesis project. Ultimately it will be a web application, allowing the user to register to online courses and watch material to learn subjects.

##Tools used##
The project is a Maven one, created with NetBeans 8.0 and uses JavaSE 8 and JavaEE 7. It's built and deployed on GlassFish 4.0, while the RDBMS is JavaDB pre-installed with the JDK. The presentation layer is built with JavaServer Faces 2.2.

##Initial Login Code##
I created and set up the project following the tutorial on this [Youtube video](http://youtu.be/1xsU6juUZd0) and working with the code of [Jim Lombardo](https://github.com/jlombardo/jsfsecure). I edited the code to my preferences but the initial code and some of the existing code in my project, is still his.

##TO-DO Login Code##
Ultimately, I want to alter the login process to use Managed Beans instead of the internal Glassfish authorization mechanism.
