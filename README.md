#Web Tutoring Site JavaEE 7#
======================
This is my JavaEE 7 thesis project. Ultimately it will be a web application, allowing the user to register to online courses and watch material to learn subjects.

##Tools used##
The project is a Maven one, created with NetBeans 8.0 and uses JavaSE 8 and JavaEE 7. It's built and deployed on GlassFish 4.0, while the RDBMS is JavaDB pre-installed with the JDK.
