#Web Tutoring Site JavaEE 7#
======================
This is my JavaEE 7 thesis project. Ultimately it will be a web application, allowing the user to register to online courses and watch material to learn subjects.

##Initial Login Code##
I created and set up the project following the tutorial on this [Youtube video](http://youtu.be/1xsU6juUZd0) and working with the code of [Jim Lombardo](https://github.com/jlombardo/jsfsecure). I edited the code to my preferences but the initial code and some of the existing code in my project, is still his.

##TO-DO##
I have a public [Trello](https://trello.com/b/rWthfmdU/javaee7-thesis) project in which you can see what features I'm planning to add, what I'm working on and what has been completed. Of course the To-Do card is constantly updated with features I want to add.
